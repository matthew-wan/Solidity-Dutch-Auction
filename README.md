# Solidity-Dutch-Auction

Simple dutch auction contract. Auction can be started at a specific price and any bidder who finds this price to be acceptable
can pay the price at which point the auction will end. If no bidders are interested in the auction, the price will automatically lower
over a certain period until either a bidder finds the price to be acceptable or the price reaches the minimum price at which point the
auction will end.
